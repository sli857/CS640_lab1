Q2:
Prediction:
The expected latency between h1 and h4 should approximately equal to the sum of latencies of L1, L2, L3. 
Prediction: ~162 ms

The expected throughput between h1 and h4 should approximately equal to the minimum of throughputs of links L1, L2, L3.
Prediction: ~1707540.800 mbps
   
Q3:
Prediction:
We believe no matter how many hosts are simultaneously talking to hosts connected to s4, the latency should remain the same as a single talk.
Prediction for two pairs and three pairs: ~162 ms

However for throughput, I think the throughput will be divided by the number of active talks.
Prediction for two pairs: ~1707540.800/2 = ~853770.4 mbps
Prediction for three pairs: ~1707540.800/2 = ~569180.267 mbps

Measurement:
Two pairs:
    avg latency: 
                h1-h4: 160.645 ms 
                h7-h9: 161.969 ms
                Prediction is correct. Indeed, the latencies are not affected by multiplexing.
    throughput: 
                h1-h4: 756331.200 mbps
                h7-h9: 806041.600 mbps
                Prediction is correct, each of them is approximately half of the original.

Three pairs:
    avg latency: 
                h1-h4: 161.685 ms
                h7-h9: 161.520 ms
                h8-h10: 162.160 ms
                Prediction is correct.
    throughput: 
                h1-h4: 564565.600 mbps
                h7-h9: 562142.000 mbps
                h8-h10: 675383.200 mbps
                Prediction is correct, each of them is approximately one third of the original.

Q4:
Prediction:
We believe the latencies are still not affected, which means h1-h4 is the sum of L1, L2, L3, and h5-h6 is the sum of L4, L2, L5
    h1-h4: ~162 ms
    h5-h6: ~41 ms

However for throughput, the throughput of L2 should be halved and the become the minimum for both sets {L1, L2, L3} and {L4, L2, L5}.
Therefore, the throughput of both paths should be approximately half of L2's throughput.
    h1-h4: ~866857.6 mbps
    h5-h6: ~866857.6 mbps

Measurement:
    avg latency:
        h1-h4: 161.719 ms
        h5-h6: 41.187 ms
        Prediction is correct. Indeed, the latency are not affected in this case.
    throughput:
        h1-h4: 773812.400 mbps
        h5-h6: 819841.200 mbps
        Prediction is mostly correct. Each throughput is approximately half of L2's throughput. However, both actual throughputs are lower,
        which indicates there are more obstacles such as congestion or queueing.
